This example shows NeuralNet, which was learned through the program, present the possibility of stock changes after June 28, 2021.

## Welcome to StockNeuralNet
It is a program that learns artificial neural networks from data from various changes in stocks (e.g., "volume", "adjust closed price", etc.), and then predicts changes in stocks over a certain period of time through the artificial neural networks.
