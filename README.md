# StockNeuralNet

📈 StockNeuralNet is a program that uses neural networks to predict future stock prices. The program was created by Jeonghoon Lee using the knowledge gained from one of my class in AI.

🧠 The neural network code was written entirely by Jeonghoon Lee, without the use of external libraries (except for the Yahoo Finance API for obtaining stock prices). The program supports multi-threading and TCP network socket connections for combining separate neural networks and reducing training time.

🕐 With the use of these features, I was able to reduce the training time from 3 days to 1 day. By utilizing the computation power of four computers over TCP, the neural network training was eventually completed in just 8 hours.

## Installation
